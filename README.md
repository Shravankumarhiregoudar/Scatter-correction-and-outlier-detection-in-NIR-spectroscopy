# Scatter-correction-and-outlier-detection-in-NIR-spectroscopy
Recent advancements in the field of AI have given rise to the integration of NIR sensor data and machine learning techniques to achieve the results. In this article, The NIR sensor is interfaced with a PC and the samples were scanned. We performed ten scans per each sample with ten seconds scan time to reduce the errors and include all the parts of the sample. In our case, the scan results were scattered and, we had outliers due to change in the light, working distance and human errors during the scanning. To reduce the scattering and to eliminate the outliers, we implemented Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC) and Standard Normal Variate (SNV) on near-infrared (NIR) data.
